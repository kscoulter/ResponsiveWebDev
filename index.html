    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME!

It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful? '! You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things. …hey. …the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.</p>

    <p>No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness.

Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.

Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time!
All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong?
I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself.
Saving the world with meals on wheels.

I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong?

I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks!
You've swallowed a planet!
You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME!</p>

    <p>You've swallowed a planet! Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff.<p>
